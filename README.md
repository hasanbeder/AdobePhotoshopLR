## üìã Customizing Application Icon

### Method 1: Using Finder (Detailed Steps)
1. Locate your new icon file (must be in `.icns` format)
2. Right-click the `Adobe Photoshop LR.app` in Finder
3. Select "Show Package Contents"
4. Navigate to `Contents/Resources/` folder
5. Find the existing `ApplicationStub.icns` file
6. Drag and drop your new icon, replacing the existing one
   - macOS will prompt you to confirm replacement
   - Click "Replace" to update the icon

### Method 2: Using Terminal
```bash
# Rename your icon to match the app's icon
mv "YourNewIcon.icns" "ApplicationStub.icns"

# Replace the app's icon
cp "ApplicationStub.icns" "Adobe Photoshop LR.app/Contents/Resources/"
```

üìù How to Use:
1. Create or download your `.icns` icon file
2. Rename the icon file to match the app's icon name
3. Place the commands in the same folder as the app
4. Run the commands in Terminal
5. The app's icon will change instantly

### Icon Requirements
- Must be in `.icns` format
- Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 pixels
- Use tools like [Image2icon](https://img2icnsapp.com/) for conversion

### Troubleshooting Icon Changes
- If icon doesn't update immediately:
  - Restart Finder: `killall Finder`
  - Clear icon cache: `sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \;`
  - Restart Dock: `killall Dock`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- Verify Photoshop installation path
- Check macOS security settings
- Ensure script has execute permissions

## üìã Troubleshooting Permissions
- If the app won't open, try these commands:
  ```bash
  # For the app in Applications folder
  xattr -cr "/Applications/Adobe Photoshop LR.app"
  
  # For the app in a custom location
  xattr -cr "/path/to/Adobe Photoshop LR.app"
  ```
- This removes macOS security attributes that might block the app

## üìã Known Limitations

- Requires manual updates
- May need reconfiguration after major macOS updates
- Limited to single Photoshop installation
